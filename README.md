# VectorOperations

This program does various operations with sets using Vectors. It determines the following:
  1. Difference of two sets, meaning those values in setA but not in setB 
  2. Intersection of two sets, containing values in set A that are also in set B
  3. Union of two sets, containing values in set A and set B
  
Works only if compiled with C++11.
